May be, you have allready noticed and used the two macros : ,re that merges all the "[Rr][Ee]:" in the subject in only one "Re:" and ,Re that merges "[Rr][Re]: Re[n]" in "Re[n+1]". 
This file combines the features from both macros without any visual bell or incremention of the first number in the subject.
